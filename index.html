      <p>I have a BEd from the Univeristy of South Africa (UNISA), but am
        currently working as a freelance transcriber while pursuing a career
        in programming.<br>
        My current focus is learning <em>Python</em>, with the goal of pursuing a
        career in the realm of machine learning. Though I'm taking a short break to
        learn the basics of web development.</p>

        <p>I've been learning the very basics of HTML and CSS as I believe that
          it's one of the best ways to show my work, and is also a skill that could be
          useful regardless of my position. <br>
